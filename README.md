# Ingenius2023 Tech 

This repo contains the following (It's a monorepo) : 
- Regular website frontend, use for sponsors advertising. 
- Backend for QR code scanning 
- Frontend for QR code scanning 

# Regular frontend 
- Contains a reg link to a type form (This allowed us to dynamically change the forms and the forn content as when needed)
- Contained info about the hack 
- Contained sponsors logo.

## QR code scanner : 
- This helps with recording various event of the hackathon, such as attendance, food and leaving. 
- This was however a failed trial in Ingenius2023. The code if fully functional, but the frontend scanning the QR was highly sensitive to light and was not fast enuf (It was later found that iPhone did a good job at scanning).
